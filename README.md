# CTerrain
Map manager for Worms 2.
- Play maps from Online Worms, Worms Armageddon, Worms World Party & Worms 2 Demo.
- Use custom colour maps. Create your own with [W2ColormapGen](https://github.com/Dawid8plc/W2ColormapGen) and they should appear in your map list.
- Save the last map you played.

## Install and run
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/Carlmundo/CTerrain/releases/latest) and extract the files to the Worms 2 game folder.
- The 3 folders: CTerrain, Data & Levels should all be in the same folder as worms2.exe.
- Open the CTerrain folder and run CTerrain.exe.

## How to use
1. Select a map in the list.
2. Set or change any options if you wish.
3. Click the Set button. The map will be locked and the next game uses that map.
4. You can manually unlock the map by clicking "Unlock File" or this will be done automatically when you close the application.

- Every map has a preset list of spawn locations. You can randomise this by checking the "Spawn Seed" checkbox and entering some text.
- Spawn seeds are not supported with dual layer maps

## Online play
When playing online make sure that all players have the exact same map, Cavern option checked/unchecked and Spawn Seed. If they don't, players will disconnect when the game launches.
